"""PreToolUse hook: deny file-edit tools access to governance artifacts
installed by the toolkit's refresh. One script, two harnesses.

Installed governance is toolkit-owned (owner ruling 2026-07-16): no in-repo
edit to an installed copy is legitimate; changes route through the toolkit
and propagate by refresh. This hook is defense in depth for the harnesses
with verified blocking hooks - Claude Code and codex - while the primary
layers stay the AGENTS.md invariant and refresh's converge-to-shipped
restore. Blocking uses the JSON permissionDecision deny on stdout with
exit 0: the one shape both harnesses honor (codex logs an exit-2 hook as
failed and lets the tool proceed; Claude Code accepts either - both
probe-verified, see docs/harness-capabilities.md 2026-08-01). Every
failure mode inside the hook exits 0 with no output (fail-open) so a
broken hook can never break editing.

The PROTECTED set is the shipped target list from tools/shipped-set.json,
kept in lockstep by a toolkit test - edit it only via the toolkit.
