description: Run the openreview playbook with a named reviewer agent for an unprimed goal-first review of a whole change. Use when the owner says openreview <agent>.

Run the `openreview` playbook operator: read
`.agents/playbooks/openreview.md` and follow it to get one unprimed,
goal-first review of a whole change from the agent named in your request
(e.g. `/openreview codex`, `/openreview grok`, `/openreview agy`). The named
agent is the reviewer harness; it is dispatched headless and one-shot over a
pinned base..head range per the playbook. If the playbook does not exist in
this repo, say so rather than guessing. The playbook is the authoritative
definition; this file is only a pointer.
