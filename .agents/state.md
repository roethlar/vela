# Agent State

This file is the first place future agents should read for current repo state.
Keep it short and update it when important repo facts change. Landed or
superseded entries rotate verbatim to `docs/history/state-archive.md`.

Machine-specific facts (host paths, tool quirks, the E2E venue) live in
`.agents/machines.md`, never here — this file stays portable.

## Now

- Product behavior remains as settled in `.agents/decisions.md`: Vela is a
  multi-server Plex/Jellyfin/experimental-Emby client, delegates HDR playback
  to external mpv, uses title-level watched state across duplicate copies, and
  offers Prefer Best, Prefer Compatible, Prefer Fastest Source, Ask Every Time,
  and per-title Play Version.

## Next

- The owner requested an ascending/descending direction option for library
  sorting on 2026-07-28. Current sort choices encode one fixed direction each;
  Revision 1 is drafted in `.agents/plans/library-sort-direction.md` and awaits
  the owner's control-contract decision. No implementation or review loop is
  active.
- Parked future directions, not current blockers: the migration-time one-shot
  Plex-to-Jellyfin/Emby watched-state copy; real Emby integration coverage; and
  a full frontend TLS multi-Plex rebind fixture if a second Plex server or
  suitable trusted mock becomes available.
- The rare queued watch-edit race remains an owner-accepted, disclosed 1.0
  limitation; its durable technical record is
  `.agents/plans/continue-watching-watch-state.md`.
## Blockers

- No known technical blocker to planning the sort-direction option. Product
  code remains gated on an approved plan.
- The unrelated continuation/mpv and `refresh` E2E flakes remain recorded; they
  were not retried or repaired under `tr-13`.

## Verification

- Canonical commands live in `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (Verification). Do not
  duplicate here.
- Linux live-server venue details live in `.agents/machines.md`.
- Release verification immutable artifact hashes live in
  `.agents/plans/v1-release-readiness.md`.
