# Agent State

This file is the first place future agents should read for current repo state.
Keep it short and update it when important repo facts change. Landed or
superseded entries rotate verbatim to `docs/history/state-archive.md`.

Machine-specific facts (host paths, tool quirks, the E2E venue) live in
`.agents/machines.md`, never here — this file stays portable.

## Now

- The 2026-08-05 README refresh split the old monolith: README.md is now
  end-user-facing with new real-library screenshots (`docs/images/vela-*.png`,
  server name scrubbed to "Plex"); deep user reference moved to
  `docs/usage.md`, build/dev/architecture to `docs/development.md`. The
  2026-07-25 transcoding-statement guards in `tests/transcoding-ui.test.mjs`
  were repointed from README.md to docs/usage.md with owner approval.
- Vela 1.0.60 is published as GitHub's Latest release from exact commit
  `10b968b583a44c4738ece324b5fcbb9d58276235` — the FIRST SIGNED release:
  the macOS universal DMG is Developer ID signed and notarized (spctl
  `Notarized Developer ID`), the Windows MSI + NSIS are Authenticode signed
  (Azure Trusted Signing); Linux and Arch artifacts remain unsigned by
  design. Its canonical workflow, checksum, local signature-inspection, and
  publication evidence lives in `.agents/plans/v1-release-readiness.md`.
- Product behavior remains as settled in `.agents/decisions.md`: Vela is a
  multi-server Plex/Jellyfin/experimental-Emby client, delegates HDR playback
  to external mpv, uses title-level watched state across duplicate copies, and
  offers Prefer Best, Prefer Compatible, Prefer Fastest Source, Ask Every Time,
  and per-title Play Version.

- Release code signing merged at `b9c6199` (2026-08-07) shipped in 1.0.60.
  The wiring detail and durable tauri-cli signing facts live in
  `docs/history/state-archive.md` (2026-08-08 rotation). The merged
  `ci/release-code-signing` branch still exists locally and on `github`;
  deleting it is owner-gated.

## Next

- Launch marketing drafts are in-repo: GitHub social preview
  `docs/images/social-preview.png` (1280×640) and Reddit copy
  `docs/marketing/reddit-launch-post.md`. Still awaiting owner go to set the
  GitHub repo social image and to post on Reddit.
- Parked future directions, not current blockers: the migration-time one-shot
  Plex-to-Jellyfin/Emby watched-state copy; real Emby integration coverage; and
  a full frontend TLS multi-Plex rebind fixture if a second Plex server or
  suitable trusted mock becomes available.
- The rare queued watch-edit race remains an owner-accepted, disclosed 1.0
  limitation; its durable technical record is
  `.agents/plans/continue-watching-watch-state.md`.
## Blockers

- No known product blocker.
- The unrelated continuation/mpv and `refresh` E2E flakes remain recorded.
  They reproduced during the 1.0.59 full Linux run in `continueon`,
  `playverbs`, and `refresh` (36/39); the changed `sortpersist` scenario passed.

## Verification

- Canonical commands live in `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (Verification). Do not
  duplicate here.
- Linux live-server venue details live in `.agents/machines.md`.
- Release verification immutable artifact hashes live in
  `.agents/plans/v1-release-readiness.md`.
