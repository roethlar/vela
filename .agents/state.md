# Agent State

This file is the first place future agents should read for current repo state.
Keep it short and update it when important repo facts change. Landed or
superseded entries rotate verbatim to `docs/history/state-archive.md`.

## Now

- **PRODUCT DIRECTION (2026-07-08, owner): Vela is a multi-server client.**
  Local/SMB/SSH sources are REMOVED (decision `.agents/decisions.md`
  2026-07-08; plan `.agents/plans/drop-local-sources.md`, plan-review accepted
  r5). The owner is Plex-first today and will eventually migrate to Jellyfin
  or Emby; the watch-state migration goal is a one-shot direct Plex→JF/Emby
  copy in Vela at migration time if simple (no Trakt relay). Nothing of that
  tool is built yet.
- **DLS (drop-local-sources): slice 1 LANDED + owner-playtested 2026-07-08**
  (0.1.33, `6855df5`; loop `dls-s1` clean r1; full detail rotated to
  `docs/history/state-archive.md`). **Slice 3 (docs sweep) LANDED
  2026-07-09, loop `dls-s3` accepted at r5** (`861442f` + four fix commits
  through `ec6a4b9`; trail in `.agents/review/index.md`) — README/ISSUES/
  repo-guidance de-localed, obsolete plans bannered, decision statuses
  closed/amended, config round-trip guard extended to legacy SMB
  credentials (guard-proven); repo-map refresh moot (file retired
  2026-07-08). REMAINING: **slice 2 —
  E2E re-home to mock servers (LINUX HOST ONLY; tests/e2e is knowingly
  broken until then, and the re-home must also rewrite scenarios written
  against click-to-play — since the nav flip, library card clicks open info
  pages)** — in progress 2026-07-09 on the owner's Linux VM.
- **ITEM-DETAIL TRACK: COMPLETE and owner-verified through 0.1.36
  (2026-07-09)** — nav flip (`74ff385`), episode navigation polish
  (`f1e36d3`+`cc9f060`), detail crumb trail (`496218e`); loops idv-s3/s4/s5
  in `.agents/review/index.md`; full history rotated to the archive and
  `.agents/plans/item-detail-view.md`. No open defect; further Plex polish
  only on the next owner report. JF/Emby `item_detail` stays deferred on an
  explicit owner go. No automated frontend guard (no JS runner; E2E is
  Linux-only) — owner playtests are the behavioral check.
- **PERSON BROWSE (clickable actor/director/writer → filtered grid):
  COMPLETE — owner playtest VERIFIED 2026-07-09 ("works well") on 0.1.39.**
  Plan `.agents/plans/person-browse.md`; slice 1 backend `35fcc67` (loop
  `pb-s1` clean r1), slice 2 frontend `b290b31` (loop `pb-s2` clean r1),
  bumps `62fd927`/`8204a77`. No open defect; JF/Emby person browse stays
  deferred on an explicit owner go (same bar as JF/Emby `item_detail`).
- Outstanding owner playtest asks (older builds): (1) library sorting
  0.1.30 — sort dropdown on Plex libraries + merged All view; (2) mpv
  autocrop 0.1.22 — Shift+C / Automatic crop on the real HDR stack.
- **machine-local (Windows dev host, `F:\dev\vela`):** the `ptk` MCP server
  (warm PowerShell runspace, `ptk_invoke`) is the DIRECT shell for agent
  harnesses on this host — probe it before assuming no shell / delegating
  shell work to subagents (2026-07-09 lesson: an entire session ran shell
  through subagent indirection with ptk available the whole time);
  cargo/rustc need valid stdin — `cmd /c "cargo ... < nul"` (rustup shim
  quirk); codex lives at `%APPDATA%\npm\codex.cmd`, headless via
  `codex exec --json --sandbox read-only` with the prompt on stdin;
  unix-cfg-gated cargo tests are excluded here (Linux CI is authoritative —
  don't record the local count, it rots); clippy baseline = 4 pre-existing
  cfg-dead mpv-installer warnings (post-removal; was 13); the E2E harness
  does NOT run here (Linux WebKitWebDriver); checkout is autocrlf=true
  (empty-diff "modified" files are line-ending noise). NOTE: whether this
  block belongs in TRACKED state at all is a filed toolkit defect
  (roethlar/AgentGovernanceBootstrap#2, 2026-07-09 — the handoff operator
  conflicts with the toolkit's own `*.local.*` convention); expect a future
  governance refresh to move it to an untracked `state.local.md`-style home.
- Version 0.1.39 (bumped `8204a77`, 2026-07-09). **Both remotes (origin +
  github) are at `a39be7f` == local HEAD as of 2026-07-09** (verified via
  `ls-remote`; owner pushes manually — policy `.agents/push-policy.md`).
  **GitHub CI is GREEN on the pushed head `a39be7f`** (verified via
  `gh run list` 2026-07-09).

## Next

- DLS slice 2 (E2E re-home) — the owner's Linux VM is the venue:
  **machine-local (mac host `/Users/michael/Dev/vela`):** VM at
  `michael@192.168.64.5` (Ubuntu 25.10 aarch64, 12 CPU, ~3.3 GiB RAM —
  tight for the debug build; RAM bump requested), clone target `~/dev/vela`;
  VM on hold 2026-07-09 while the owner installs OS updates.
- Migration-time (not now): plan the one-shot Plex→JF/Emby watch-state copy
  (provider-id matching; both APIs already integrated).
- QUEUED LAST (owner, 2026-07-08, from the 0.1.33 playtest — "add this to the
  bottom of the queue"): **Continue Watching carousel needs a one-op
  curation.** Owner-reported annoyance: "if I mark a video in the carousel as
  unwatched, it stays in the carousel. if I remove it from continue watching,
  the watched status remains. so I have to do two ops to get what I want."
  Design when picked up (plan first; options include a combined context-menu
  action or changing what each action implies) — not spec'd yet.

## Blockers

- None recorded.

## Verification

- Canonical commands live in `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (Verification) —
  frontend `npm run check` / `npm run build`; Rust from `src-tauri/`:
  `cargo check --locked`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D
  warnings`, `cargo test --locked`; `npm run e2e` (Linux only; broken until
  DLS slice 2 re-homes it to mock servers).

## Active Sources

- `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (governance refreshed 2026-07-08,
  toolkit `6f08a67`; verification commands now live in repo-guidance)
- `.agents/decisions.md`
- `.agents/plans/drop-local-sources.md` (ACTIVE — slices 1+3 landed, 2 open)
- `.agents/plans/item-detail-view.md` (ACTIVE — nav flip landed; polish)
- `.agents/plans/person-browse.md` (COMPLETE — owner-verified 2026-07-09)
- `.agents/review/index.md` (durable review trails)
- `docs/history/state-archive.md` (rotated state entries)
- `README.md`, `ISSUES.md` (swept by DLS slice 3, 2026-07-09)
